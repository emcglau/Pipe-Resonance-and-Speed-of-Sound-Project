The local speed of sound is a variable that is important to know for various science and engineering applications, such as acoustic design, ultrasound imaging, and sonar. This experiment aimed to explore the accuracy ofusing pipe resonance and mathematical model fitting to find the local speed of sound in comparison to literature values. A Bluetooth speaker was set up to play white noise (all-frequency noise with even frequency distribution) through an open-open pipe containing a microphone connected to an oscilloscope taking time-domain data. This data was then fast Fourier transformed and fitted to a mathematical model to retrieve the local speed of sound and the end correction coefficient. This fit yielded a value of 337.5 ± 13.81 m/s for the speed of sound, which matched the expected value of 343.7 m/s within uncertainty. Although future experiments would be required to increase precision, the utilization of pipe resonance and analytical fit methods is a promising avenue of determining the local speed of sound.
